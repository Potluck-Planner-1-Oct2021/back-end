example : on postman => Select Body -  chose raw and change where it said text to JSON
```
{
    "username": "jim",
    "password": "1234"
}
```
### a successful respose will look like this ,depending on entering email since email is not required
```
{
    "username": "jim",
    "password": "$2a$04$uAAmGlQDDkPWmAY4j1JHA.ZXfGYDJsU13NS.Y8hY8tcGzFZnWivIm",
